## Write Code to Arduino Code.

Install Arduino IDE,
or use a Alternate Program if preferred.

Follow instructions in the software to write the code to the Arduino.

Recommended Arduino is the Mega2560 or *(possibly) Uno V3*.

Ethernet Adapter with the Arduino was a Arduino Ethernet Shield.

Display used for my tests was a SainSmart V1 Display with buttons.

Kind of a Project I made while I was bored and this is the result. any help is appreciated. Code is gonna be sketchy its all new to me.
